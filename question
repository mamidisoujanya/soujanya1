Create a TCP/UDP server-client application. The corresponding jobs of the client and server are described below.
Client:
1. Render menu like the application to add, remove a device, edit the required attribute for the requested device.
2. It should send a packet in the following format.
|         1 Byte         |          1 Byte        |          1 Byte        |          1 Byte        |        N Bytes   |
+---------------------++---------------------++---------------------++---------------------++-----------------++ --
|     Command      |     Device ID        |       Attribute ID   |  Att Value Len(N) |    Attr Value    | ...
+---------------------++---------------------++---------------------++---------------------++-----------------++ --
The command can be enum for Read/Write and their responses.
Attribute ID can be enum to represent the corresponding Device attribute.
3. When the client receives a response for the requested attribute it should display to the user.

Server:
1. When it receives a write attribute/add device command it should save the details in one file called database file.
2. The format of how the details will be stored in the database file should be defined in some header file.
Like the first 256 bytes are for device 1, the next 256 bytes are for device 2 ….
In every 256 bytes define offsets for each attribute.
Define max limits for string attributes. Like Manufacturer name should not exceed 31.
3. When a client sends a command to read attribute for the specified device ID then it should calculate the offset to read and send the response with the data in the above format.

Note: Typical Device attributes are device number, Name, Location, Manufacture Name,…
