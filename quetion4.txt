Use the curl library to implement the following HTTP requests. Use the Philips Hue Bridge as an HTTP server for these queries.
    First add the Hue bridge to Almond to get the "username", "bridge IP" and use that in the following queries. These details can be found from the "/almond/decodedb 1 /tmp/ddb" command.
    http://<bridge IP>/api/<username>/lights -- GET request to get all the lights that are associated with that bridge. Print the JSON response on the console.
    http://<bridge IP>/api/<username>/lights/<id> -- GET request to get the attributes of light with given ID
    http://<bridge IP>/api/<username>/lights/<id> -- PUT request to change the name of the light, body of the request -- {"name":"Living Room Light"}
    http://<bridge IP>/api/<username>/lights/<id>/state -- PUT request to set attribute values, for example on/off, change brightness and to change the color. body of the request -- { "hue": 50000, "on": true, "bri": 200 } (only the required tags you should keep in the body)
